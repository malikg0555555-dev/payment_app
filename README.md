💳 Payment System – Python Backend & Responsive Frontend

A full-stack payment simulation project built with Python (Flask) and a modern, responsive HTML/CSS/JavaScript frontend.
This project demonstrates runtime polymorphism, clean architecture, and real-world backend–frontend integration.

🚀 Features

✅ Python Flask backend

✅ Runtime polymorphism (Payment Methods)

✅ Responsive & modern UI

✅ HTML / CSS / JavaScript frontend

✅ REST API communication

✅ Clean project structure (industry standard)

✅ Beginner-friendly & interview-ready

🧠 Core Concept Used
🔁 Runtime Polymorphism (Backend)

All payment methods share a common interface and are handled dynamically at runtime.

payment.pay(amount)


This allows the system to support multiple payment methods without changing existing logic.

⚙️ Installation & Setup
1️⃣ Clone Repository
git clone https://github.com/your-username/payment-system.git
cd payment-system

2️⃣ Install Dependencies
pip install flask

3️⃣ Run Application
python app.py

4️⃣ Open in Browser
http://127.0.0.1:5000

🧪 How It Works

User selects payment method and amount in browser

JavaScript sends request to Flask backend

Backend selects payment class dynamically

Polymorphic pay() method executes

Result is returned and displayed in UI
